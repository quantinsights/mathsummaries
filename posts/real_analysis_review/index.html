<p>These are unofficial solutions to the undergrad text, <em>Understanding Analysis</em> by Stephen Abbott. I started writing these solutions, when I was self-studying and taking a first course in real analysis, and felt that I might as well give the problems an effort by writing out solutions.</p>

<h3 id="why-should-i-read-this">Why should I read this?</h3>
<p>While the official solutions may be more accurate, they may be terse and sometimes hard to understand, so a different perspective may help. I found introductory Real Analysis to be a very visual topic, so I&rsquo;ve drawn tiny pictures wherever possible to get a gut, intuitive feel of what&rsquo;s going on. In addition, my proofs were done mostly independent of the official solutions.</p>
