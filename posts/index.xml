      <description>Previously, we consider the solution of a single equation of the form $f(x) = 0$, where $f$ is a real-valued function defined and continuous on a closed interval of the real line. The simplest example of this kind is the linear equation $ax = b$, where $a$ and $b$ are given real numbers, with $a \neq 0$, whose solution is
$$x = a^{-1}b$$
trivially. Of course, we could have expressd the solution as $x = b/a$ as in the previous post, but as we will see in a moment, writing $x = a^{-1}b$ is much more revealing in the present context.</description>

      <description>Real Analysis. These are unofficial solutions to the undergrad text, Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott. I started writing these solutions, when I was self-studying and taking a first course in real analysis, and felt that I might as well give the problems an effort by writing out solutions.

Why should I read this? While the official solutions may be more accurate, they may be terse and sometimes hard to understand, so a different perspective may help.</description>
