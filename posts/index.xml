      <description>Real Analysis. These are unofficial solutions to the undergrad text, Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott. I started writing these solutions, when I was self-studying and taking a first course in real analysis, and felt that I might as well give the problems an effort by writing out solutions.

Why should I read this? While the official solutions may be more accurate, they may be terse and sometimes hard to understand, so a different perspective may help.</description>
