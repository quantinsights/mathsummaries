      <description>Equations with constant coefficients. Linear differential equations with constant coefficients, that is equations of the form:
$$\begin{aligned} a_{n}y^{(n)}+a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)}+\ldots+a_{0}y &amp;amp; =h(x)\quad\tag{1} \end{aligned}$$
in which $a_{0},a_{1},\ldots,a_{n}\neq0$ are real constants, are in many respects the simplest of all differential equations. For one thing, they can be discussed entirely within the context of linear algebra and form the only substantial class of equations with order greater than one that can be explicitly solved. This, plus the fact, that such equations arise in a surprisingly wide variety of physical problems, accounts for a special place they occupy in the theory of linear differential equations.</description>

      <description>The general theory of linear differential equations. Introduction. Consider the differential operator :
$$\begin{aligned} D:\mathcal{C}^{1}([a,b]) &amp;amp; \mapsto\mathcal{C}([a,b])\\ y=f(x) &amp;amp; \mapsto\frac{dy}{dx} \end{aligned}$$
Since $D$ preserves sums and scalar products,
$$\begin{aligned} \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)+g(x)] &amp;amp; =\frac{df}{dx}+\frac{dg}{dx}\\ \frac{d}{dx}[kf(x)] &amp;amp; =k\frac{df}{dx} \end{aligned}$$
$D$ is a linear operator.
The operator $D^{2}[f]$ can be defined as the composition $D(D(f))$. The essential fact about such compositions is that they are always linear. Indeed, if $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary functions in $\mathcal{C}^{2}([a,b])$, we have:</description>
