      <description>Introduction. Equations of various kinds arise in physical applications and a substantial body of mathematical research is devoted to their study. Some equations are rather simple. In our high school days, we all encountered the single linear equation $ax + b = 0$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $a \neq 0$, whose solution is given by $x = -b/a$. Many equations are however non-linear: a simple example is $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, $a \neq 0$, involving a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients $a,b,c$ and $a \neq 0$.</description>
