      <description>In 1689, Jakob Bernoulli published his Tractus de seriebus infinitis summarizing what was known about the infinite series towards the end of the 17th century. Full of clever calculations and conclusions, this publication was also notable for one particular question that it didn&amp;rsquo;t answer; namely, what is the precise value of the series
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{16} + \ldots$$
Bernoulli convincingly argued that $\sum \frac{1}{n^2}$ converged to something less than $2$, but he was unable to find an explicit expression for the limit.</description>
