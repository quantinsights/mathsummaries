      <description>This is a short note on classical Black-Scholes, and the idea of dynamic hedging, that is, constructing a portfolio continuously in time, such that it does not have a driving $dW$ term, that is, it is locally risk-free.

      <description>Probability puzzles. Problem. Two bullets are loaded into a gun&amp;rsquo;s round barrel consecutively. The barrel has a capacity of 6. The gun is fired once, but no bullet is shot. Does rolling the barrel (shuffling) before next shot increase the probability of firing a bullet?

Solution.
Let the holes in the barrel be $1,2,3,4,5,6$ labelled clockwise. WLOG, suppose the firing pin was on hole $1$. Also, suppose the barrel rotates clockwise.</description>

      <description>Difference operators. Difference operators are handy tools for derivation, analysis and practical applications of numerical methods for many problems of interpolation, differentiation and quadrature of a function in terms of its values at equidistant arguments.
Consider the sequence $(y_n)$. Then, we define the shift operator $E$ and the forward difference operator $\Delta$ by the relations:
$$Ey_n = (y_{n+1}), \quad \Delta y_n = (y_{n+1} - y_n)$$
$E$ and $\Delta$ are thus operators which map one sequence to another sequence.</description>

      <description>These are my notes on analytic methods to solve linear second order partial differential equations, heavily based on text Partial Differential Equations: An introduction by Walter, Strauss.

      <description>Real Analysis. These are unofficial solutions to the undergrad text, Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott. I started writing these solutions, when I was self-studying and taking a first course in real analysis, and felt that I might as well give the problems an effort by writing out solutions.

Why should I read this? While the official solutions may be more accurate, they may be terse and sometimes hard to understand, so a different perspective may help.</description>

      <description>XMag is the second Hugo theme I have designed. It is based on my first Hugo theme XMin, and similarly, features minimalism but with a magazine style on the homepage inspired by The Signpost on Wikipedia. You can find its source code on Github: https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmag (licensed under MIT).
Features This theme includes a few cool features:
Responsive article summary blocks on homepage
Thumbnails in summary blocks
Magazine title in Blackletter (ùîÖùîèùîÑ‚Ñ≠ùîé ùîèùîàùîóùîóùîà‚Ñú)</description>
