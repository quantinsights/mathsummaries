      <description>Probability puzzles. Problem. Two bullets are loaded into a gun&amp;rsquo;s round barrel consecutively. The barrel has a capacity of 6. The gun is fired once, but no bullet is shot. Does rolling the barrel (shuffling) before next shot increase the probability of firing a bullet?
https://brainstellar.com/puzzles/easy/1
Solution.
Let the holes in the barrel be $1,2,3,4,5,6$ labelled clockwise. WLOG, suppose the firing pin was on hole $1$. Also, suppose the barrel rotates clockwise.</description>

      <description>Equations with constant coefficients. Linear differential equations with constant coefficients, that is equations of the form:
$$\begin{aligned} a_{n}y^{(n)}+a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)}+\ldots+a_{0}y &amp;amp; =h(x)\quad\tag{1} \end{aligned}$$
in which $a_{0},a_{1},\ldots,a_{n}\neq0$ are real constants, are in many respects the simplest of all differential equations. For one thing, they can be discussed entirely within the context of linear algebra and form the only substantial class of equations with order greater than one that can be explicitly solved. This, plus the fact, that such equations arise in a surprisingly wide variety of physical problems, accounts for a special place they occupy in the theory of linear differential equations.</description>

      <description>The general theory of linear differential equations. Introduction. Consider the differential operator :
$$\begin{aligned} D:\mathcal{C}^{1}([a,b]) &amp;amp; \mapsto\mathcal{C}([a,b])\\ y=f(x) &amp;amp; \mapsto\frac{dy}{dx} \end{aligned}$$
Since $D$ preserves sums and scalar products,
$$\begin{aligned} \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)+g(x)] &amp;amp; =\frac{df}{dx}+\frac{dg}{dx}\\ \frac{d}{dx}[kf(x)] &amp;amp; =k\frac{df}{dx} \end{aligned}$$
$D$ is a linear operator.
The operator $D^{2}[f]$ can be defined as the composition $D(D(f))$. The essential fact about such compositions is that they are always linear. Indeed, if $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary functions in $\mathcal{C}^{2}([a,b])$, we have:</description>

      <description>Difference operators. Difference operators are handy tools for derivation, analysis and practical applications of numerical methods for many problems of interpolation, differentiation and quadrature of a function in terms of its values at equidistant arguments.
Consider the sequence $(y_n)$. Then, we define the shift operator $E$ and the forward difference operator $\Delta$ by the relations:
$$Ey_n = (y_{n+1}), \quad \Delta y_n = (y_{n+1} - y_n)$$
$E$ and $\Delta$ are thus operators which map one sequence to another sequence.</description>

      <description>These are my notes on analytic methods to solve linear second order partial differential equations, heavily based on text Partial Differential Equations: An introduction by Walter, Strauss.

      <description>Real Analysis. These are unofficial solutions to the undergrad text, Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott. I started writing these solutions, when I was self-studying and taking a first course in real analysis, and felt that I might as well give the problems an effort by writing out solutions.

Why should I read this? While the official solutions may be more accurate, they may be terse and sometimes hard to understand, so a different perspective may help.</description>

      <description>XMag is the second Hugo theme I have designed. It is based on my first Hugo theme XMin, and similarly, features minimalism but with a magazine style on the homepage inspired by The Signpost on Wikipedia. You can find its source code on Github: https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmag (licensed under MIT).
Features This theme includes a few cool features:
Responsive article summary blocks on homepage
Thumbnails in summary blocks
Magazine title in Blackletter (ùîÖùîèùîÑ‚Ñ≠ùîé ùîèùîàùîóùîóùîà‚Ñú)</description>
